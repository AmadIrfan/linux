## Pop-Up Threads

####Before going to pop-up threads firstly have a short view on threads.

A thread refers to a single sequential flow of activities being executed in a process; it is also known as the thread of execution or the thread of control. A distinct program counter, a stack of activation records as
well as control blocks are used by each thread of the same process. Thread is frequently described as a light technique.

#### Pop-Up Threads

Threads are often useful in distributed systems. The traditional approach is to have a process or thread that waits for an incoming message. When a message arrives, it is accepted, unpacked, and processed. An alternative approach is to create a new thread (a pop-up thread) for each incoming message. This is useful for handling incoming messages quickly and efficiently.

###Why are Threads needed?

1. It takes far less time to create a new thread in an existing process than to create a new process.
2. Threads can share the common data; they do not need to use Inter- Process communication.
3. Context switching is faster when working with threads. 
4. It takes less time to terminate a thread than a process.

###Types of Threads

Two Types of threads:

1. User Level Thread
2. Kernel Level Thread

###User Level Thread

The operating system does not recognize the user-level thread. User threads can be easily implemented,and it is implemented by the user. If a user performs a user-level thread blocking operation, the whole process is blocked. The kernel level thread does not know nothing about the user level thread. Examples: Javathread, POSIX threads, etc.

###Kernel Level Thread

The kernel thread recognizes the operating system. There is a thread control block and process control block in the system for each thread and process in the kernel-level thread. The kernel-level thread is implemented by the operating system. The kernel knows about all the threads and manages them. The implementation of kernel threads is more difficult than the user thread.Context switch time is longer in the kernel thread. Example:Window Solaris.

### Code

![](picture3.jpg)

1.  In main function first make set of thread attributes and then set the default attributes create the    thread wait for thread to exit and print sum.
2. Before begin of main thread call the runner function.
3. Thread execute this function and exit.
